This is an HDL implementation of our HDC accelerator.
Here you can find the HDL implementation of the HDCA core and the system verilig simulation of it.

This is based on Zynq MPSOC and is suitable for KRIA KV260.

To create the project: 
1- Clone the repository in "any location" 
2- Open Vivado 
3- In the TCL Console write these commands 
4- cd "any location" 5- set proj_name any_project_name 
6- source ./createProject.tcl 7- Run the simulation 
8- Add the wveform config "HDC_simulator_behav.wcfg" into your waveform 
9- Enjoy!
